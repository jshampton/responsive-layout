Responsive Layout Project

> The second project created on the teamtreehouse.com Front End Development Course.
  The purpose of this code was to put the learnt skills for building a responsive website into practice.
  Requirements of the task were:
  - Using the Mobile first approach.
  - Create a number of breakpoints, so the site works effectively on tablet and desktop as well.
  - Focusing on semantic classes.
